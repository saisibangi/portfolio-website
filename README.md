# Portfolio Website: 
This is a responsive, multi-page portfolio website built with HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, deployed on GitHub Pages.

## Features
- **Three Pages**: Home (with image slider), About (skills and background), Contact (form with validation).
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly navigation with hamburger menu and adaptive layouts.
- **Interactivity**: Image slider with auto-slide and manual controls, form validation with feedback.
- **Semantic HTML5**: Proper use of `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`.
- **CSS3 Styling**: Flexbox for layout, media queries for responsiveness, and hover effects.
- **JavaScript**: Navigation toggle, image slider, and form validation.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on GitHub Pages.
- The contact form validates input but does not send data (no backend).
- The slider auto-advances every 5 seconds and supports manual navigation.
